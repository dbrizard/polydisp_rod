# Python version of the polynomial approximation coefficents

Note that:
* LA stands for $\tilde{\lambda}$, dimensionless Lame parameter $\lambda$;
* MU stands for $\tilde{\mu}$, dimensionless Lame parameter $\mu$
* both LA and MU are dict type, the key corresponds to the power (e.g. LA['4'] should contain the value of $\tilde{\lambda}$ to the power 4)

Actual numbering of files from 0 to 6 corresponds to an even number of modes from 2 to 14.
